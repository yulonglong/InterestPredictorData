Matt Hirschfelt   Edited  What a week with Brittany Hirschfelt. Saw Jeff Dunham at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino and enjoyed PBR Rock Bar for dinner on Sunday. Enjoyed 2 for 1 tickets to K by Cirque du Soleil at MGM Grand Las Vegas and a free meal at Diablo's Cantina on Monday. Enjoyed free tickets to Zumanity  The Sensual Side of Cirque du Soleil at New York - New York Hotel & Casino Las Vegas on Tuesday. Caught up with Shelly Dodson Oxley and Brian Oxley on Wednesday at Dick's Last Resort Las Vegas. And cheered on Norway with 2 for 1 tickets to the Excalibur Tournament Of The Kings Dinner Show at Excalibur Hotel Casino on Thursday before catching a flight home. Throw in 2 free lunch buffets, 2 free dinner buffets, and $10 in Freeplay and I'd call it a successful vacation! 16 Likes5 Comments Like  Comment  Share 16 people like this.
