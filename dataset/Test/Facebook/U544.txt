Hibbard, was erected in 1917 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in memory of all Southern troops who fought in the Battle of Shiloh. The inscription on the tablet of this monument reads as follows: The states of the south sent to the Battle of Shiloh seventy nine organizations of infantry, ten organizations of cavalry, and twenty three batteries of artillery. How bravely and how well they fought let the tablets o...f history on this field tell. As a greeting to the living remnant of that host of gray and in honor of its dead, whether sleeping in distant places or graveless here in traceless dust, this monument has been lifted up by the hands of a loving and grateful people. Monuments like this one have come under attack in recent weeks as society finally acknowledges the injustices of our past. But calls for the removal of these historic markers of memory are misguided and misinformed, in my view. These monuments tell us as much about ourselves and the times in which we live as they do the history they represent. Must we purge all memories of our past to conform with the present in order to form a more perfect union? I believe we must stand to preserve the memories embodied in the monuments and memorials that honor our dead, while also embracing new commemorative landscapes for those stories that have gone untold for far too long. While public displays of cloth banners -- and the inherent symbolism they represent -- are certainly matters worthy of debate and civil discourse, monuments like these and others should never fall. Let the tablets of history on this field tell should be our rallying cry, now and forever more. See More Share 3 people like this.
