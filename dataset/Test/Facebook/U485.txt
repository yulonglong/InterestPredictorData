Jay Suit shared Ehikhamenor Johncanice Ehizokhae's post.   Ehikhamenor Johncanice Ehizokhae Couldn't stop myself from forwarding this Excellent message ... A bus full of passengers was traveling while. Suddenly, the weather changed and there was a huge... downpour and lightening all around. They could see that the lightening would appear to come towards the bus, and then go elsewhere. After 2 or 3 horrible instances of being saved from lightening, the driver stopped the bus about fifty feet away from a tree and said, We have somebody in the bus whose death is a certainty today. Because of that person, everybody else will also get killed today. Now listen carefully to what i am saying, I want each person to come out of bus one by one, and touch the tree trunk and come back. Whosoever is certain of death will get caught up by the lightening, and will die & everybody else will be saved. They had to force the first person to go and touch the tree and come back. He reluctantly got down from the bus and went and touched the tree. His heart leaped with joy when nothing happened and he was still alive. This continued for rest of the passengers who were all relieved when they touched the tree, and nothing happened. When the last passenger's turn came, everybody looked at him with accusing eyes. That passenger was very afraid and reluctant, since he was the only one left. Everybody forced him to get down and go and touch the tree. With a 100% fear of death in mind, the last passenger walked to the tree and touched it. There was a huge sound of thunder and the lightening came down and hit the bus - yes, the lightening hit the bus, and killed each and every passenger inside the bus. It was because of the presence of this last passenger that, earlier,the entire bus was safe and the lightening could not strike the bus. LIFE LEARNING from this.. At times, we try to take credit for our present achievements, but this could also be because of a person right next to us. Look around you - Probably someone is there around you, in the form of your Parents, your Spouse, your Children, your Siblings, your friends, your Colleagues, etc, who are saving you from harm..! Think About it... You will surely find that Person..!!! Beautiful Lines: ''Alone I can 'Say' but together we can 'talk'. 'Alone I can 'Enjoy' but together we can 'Celebrate'. 'Alone I can 'Smile' but together we can 'Laugh'. That's the BEAUTY of Human Relations. We are nothing without each other. Most ultimately we are NOTHING without Christ!

He is a member of a Society founded chiefly for this purpose: to strive especially for the defence and propagation of th...e faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine, by means of public preaching, lectures and any other ministration whatsoever of the Word of God, and further by means of retreats, the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity, and the spiritual consolation of Christ's faithful through hearing confessions and administering the other sacraments. Moreover, he should show himself ready to reconcile the estranged, compassionately assist and serve those who are in prisons or hospitals, and indeed, to perform any other works of charity, according to what will seem expedient for the glory of God and the common good.- Ignatius Loyola, Founder of the Society of Jesus #Jesuits See More Share Obinna Emmanuel likes this.Jay Suit April 18  BlackBerry Smartphones App   there are simply no words to describe this epic treachery by South Africans! If there are people anywhere on this planet who cant afford being xenophobic, most ESPECIALLY against AFRICANS, it is the blacks of South Africa! If there is anything that can at all make god weep, it is this immense perfidy, this satanic back-stab by South Africans. It is just incredible, unconscionable rabidly so. Who would have ever thought that black people in South Africa will descend so low... as to hate a fellow African to the extent of MURDERING him/her with the degenerate excuse that there victim stole their jobs? I see white South Africans snickering in the background and whispering to each other, These people are subhuman. See what they do to each other  No! See what they do to their MESSIAHS. We told everyone so but they wouldnt believe us sweet vindication! South Africans owe everything they have today to the resolve of Africans to liberate their brethren from the putrid shackles of Apartheid! THIS IS HOW THEY PAY US BACK?! How many South Africans were educated and sheltered. Without the material, financial and emotional solidarity of African governments, could the ANC struggle have gotten anywhere? I do not want to have to have this damning impression of South Africans I dont know if its a psychological thing; some times I even think that its a Southern African thing. I have this theory that black people in Southern Africa, probably because of decades of abuse by former white masters, are mentally unbalanced, they exhibit severe self-esteem issues and are extremely insecure. I knew a couple of Zimbabweans who were one day watching a football match between Cameroon and Egypt through out the game, they entertained themselves with how ugly the Cameroonian players were in comparison to their Arab rivals. in Zimbabwe, they have an annual Ugliest Man/Woman contest! You might as well throw anyone with this kind of defeatist, self-debasing and loathing outlook right in a zoo cage. At the end of the day, all said and done, South Africans are still Africans; annoyingly so. I cant disavow the primal bond of kinship I have with them even if I tried. I must also mention that I understand that not all South Africans think and behave this way. Their government must nonetheless wake up and take a decisive action that will bring the full wrath of the law against the perpetrators of this depraved taboo. This is not the first time this has happened and the government there seem unwilling to make it clear in no uncertain terms that this is unacceptable. The government must pay reparations to all people affected otherwise we will be left with no option but to conclude that the government of South Africa is all along an accessory to this vile crime. As it stands now, South Africa is one giant monument to ingratitude and the government and people of South Africa must take all steps to change this perception or suffer dire consequences.
