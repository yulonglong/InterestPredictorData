Highland Titles Thursday smiles: THE DIFFERENCE IF YOU MARRY A SCOTTISH GIRL Three friends married women from different parts of the world........ The first man married a Greek girl. He told her that she was to do the dishes and house cleaning. It took a couple of days, but on the third day he came home to see a clean house and dishes washed and put away..... The second man married a Thai girl. He gave his wife orders that she was to do all the cleaning, dishes and the cooking. The first day he didn't see any results but the next day he saw it was better. By the third day he saw his house was clean, the dishes were done, and there was a huge dinner on the table..... The third man married a girl from Scotland . He ordered her to keep the house cleaned, dishes washed, lawn mowed, laundry washed, and hot meals on the table for every meal. The first day he didn't see anything, the second day he didn't see anything either but by the third day, some of the swelling had gone down and he could see a little out of his left eye and his arm was healed enough that he could fix himself a sandwich and load the dishwasher. He still has some difficulty when he urinates..... See More ShareWendy Melville shared a link.   Beat the Heat! Ways to stay cool Beat the Heat!

ShareWendy Melville shared Yogis Anonymous's photo.   Yogis Anonymous www.yogisanonymous.com When youre in the midst of things that are falling apart, whether they be jobs or relationships or a way of being, this is a tough conce...pt to embrace, but things fall apart so they can fall together in a different way. That doesnt mean everything is happening for a reason, it just means that this is the nature of all living thingspeople, emotions, situations, and the leaves on the trees around us. Everything is always in flux. If a relationship ends and your heart is broken, of course youre going to grieve and examine what happened, and depending upon circumstances, you may have a lot of healing to do. Those times when Ive felt desperate, or paralyzed by fear, or heartbroken because I couldnt see a path in front of me and realized Id have to cut through the brush and create one, have also been the times when Ive learned the most about myself and have grown in ways I never would have otherwise. That doesnt mean you have to put everything in a box marked thank you, it just means we always have the choice to create beauty out of our pain. Sometimes the thing thats falling apart is you. In yoga philosophy and practice, you might come upon the concept of The Dark Night of the Soul, which is not a yogic concept, but rather a poem (and later a treatise about the poem) written by the Roman Catholic mystic Saint John of the Cross. In the poem, he narrates the journey of the soul from its bodily home to its union with God. In the yogic context, we have something called isvara pranidhana, which has a few different translations: devotion to the divine, devotion to the Ultimate Reality, devotion to your True Self. Its basically that time that comes when the old way of being in the world isnt working anymore, and the new way of being isnt clear yet. The old way may include relationships, jobs, coping mechanisms, the way you see yourselfanything that feels inauthentic, that just doesnt fit right anymore, that will now have to go. Its an extremely uncomfortable, lonely, painful, and scary processand it takes a lot longer than a night. For me Id say it took about five years. Any spiritual path (and there are many), will hopefully lead you to your own truth, your own peace, your realization of the incredible and limitless well of love within you. But in order to get there, youre probably going to have to sail away from the shores you know, and head out to sea for awhile, waiting for your internal compass to kick in. Knowingly plunging yourself into darkness doesnt usually sound appealing to people unless theyve tried everything else first. Id feel comfortable saying that if the path youre on isnt making you a more compassionate person, its probably not the right path. Because ultimately, we are all so much the same. All grappling with lifes big questions: Whats the meaning of it all? What am I doing here? What happens when I die? We all breathe the same air, all live off (and on) the same planet, all love our children, all have fears and doubts and hopes and dreams and places within ourselves that need healing. So whatever you believe, I hope it opens you so that when you meet people, you really see them. And so that you realize that although they may be smiling at you, last night they could have cried into their pillow until they finally fell asleep. Because maybe everything is falling apart for them right now. Its not easy, this business of being human. Things do fall apart. We will never know for sure if our answers to those big questions are right. And one day we will die. For me personally, I feel Ive grappled with those questions and come up with answers that feel right to me. But you may answer those same questions with completely different answers, and you know, you may be right. Were all just doing our best here. The only universal thing Ive come up with that I believe in my heart, is that we are made of energy, and that energy is love. Anything else is taught and learned. When things fall apart, whether its your way of being that isnt working anymore, or its a relationship or a job, and you just cant envision how things will possibly work out, see if you can open your hands and your heart and your mind instead of clenching your fists. We cannot control circumstances. We cannot control what other people will think, or do, or say. We cannot manage anyone elses journey. But we can manage our own path, and we can keep heading toward healing and love. What I want most in this world is for my children to be happy. I want them to live in a peaceful world. I want you and your children to be happy. I truly believe we are all family. Your children are related to my children, even if you live on the other side of the planet. The only way I know to a peaceful world, is one person at a time. One person at a time taking the journey inward and doing the work to heal. One person at a time being willing to let things fall apart if they need to, so that something strong and beautiful can emerge. If your house is peaceful, if you model loving behavior for your children, if you teach them what it means to be compassionate by being compassionate, they will do as you do. And if you dont, they will also do as you do. Thats how we change the world, Im pretty sure of that. I believe almost everyone is capable of healing. I realize our culture encourages sleepwalking but I dont underestimate the power of a growing number of people who are awake. Engaged. On fire. When things fall apart, the desire to go to sleep, to numb out is understandable. But Id rather be awake and in pain than asleep. And Id rather be awake for all the incredible joy, too. Aware of all the gifts. Open to all the love. Id rather accept that everything is always changing, and that one day Im going to die. I hope its a long long time from now. But however long Ive got, I want to use every minute to spread love. I wont succeed. Im a human being. Ill get angry, or discouraged or tired or cranky or depressed sometimes. But Ill do my best. And I know you will, too. And I hope we all live long enough to see the impact of a bunch of loving people doing their best and coming together. Wouldnt that be freaking awesome? Sending you so much love, and a very big hug if things are falling apart for you right now, Ally Hamilton See More Share 4 people like this.Wendy Melville shared a link.   15 Creative Parenting Hacks To Make Life With The Kids A Little Easier No. 3 is genius! parenting.aplus.com ShareWendy Melville shared Van Belle Flowers & Garden Centre's post.   +3 Van Belle Flowers & Garden Centre added 6 new photos.
