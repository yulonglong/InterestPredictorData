Instead of saying why I think the no side is morally and factually WRONG (The disgusting hate mail Una Mullaly recieved should be enough) I'm going to say what i am voting for. I'm voting Yes for equality on Friday. Yes for fairness. Yes for the fact that it's 2015. Yes for the fact that Love and Reproduction are not interchangeable. Yes for accepting that we are diverse nation. Yes for accepting that not all m...arraiges are catholic marraiges, or even religious marraiges. Yes for my uncle, my cousins, my friends, current and former colleagues, my former classmates, so they can have the option to choose to celebrate their love by marraige like me and Dave will be able to if we choose. Yes, maybe, for my nephews and niece when they grow up. Yes for younger generations so that coming out isn't a big deal anymore. Yes for a reality which no longer sees homosexuality as something to be whispered and gossiped about. Yes for security. Yes for happiness. Yes for togetherness. Yes because I have no place in saying any couple shouldn't be able to legally commit themselves fully to one another in a secure civil marraige. Yes for the most important thing in the world; for love. T for Gr. See More Share 25 people like this. Remove Helen M Dunne YES!

Stamp out the stigma* I've no idea why I'm posting this here but feck it I'll go for it anyway; it feels right. Some people might say I...'m looking for attention but really I'm just angry because I can't get the help I need to get better. I've paid 100s on doctor and hospital fees and on tablets that only made me worse. I'm on the waiting lists for three mental health services including the HSE since October but I'm not a priority because I have a job and I don't have kids so I'm not as important as other cases. I'm sick of this country not providing people who really need help with the services they need while other people get medical cards and bus passes and other free s*** that they don't require. That, though is a whole other can of worms. As a nation we do everything backwards and we are so afraid of talking about mental illness and accepting it for what it is. We call people crazy or weird and accuse them of faking it instead of asking how we can help. This is 2015 and it's about time we talked about the D word openly and frankly. We have hover boards and flying cars for godsake- if we can progress that far in technology we should be able to do so emotionally too. They say 1 in 4 people deal with depression so I'm sure some of you reading this will relate to it. The fact is when you're going through a bout of depression your priorities change. Your main goal becomes merely to function and you're lucky if you can muster the motivation to eat at all let alone eat healthy. After recoverying from a break down in October thanks to training hard and getting a break from the main cause, I relapsed and spent most of January amd February depressed; unable to drive, debilitated by anxiety but February was coming to an end and March came and things started to look up. College was finished, I got a new job JUST in time, I passed my driving test, I started to dip my toes into what I want to do for the foreseeable future. Now it's back. Probably worse than ever. I had about a month of feeling alive. It's a rollercoaster! This had been coming for about a week until It hit me like a train on Tuesday. All it takes is one thing to trigger it. I struggle to get out of bed, never mind getting to the gym or to a class. It was practically a miracle that I got to my own Personal Training on Thursday and honestly I don't even remember driving there! I am proud of myself for smiling all day in work and making people feel good about themselves when I can't even do that for myself right now. If you think depression is just someone being negative or wound up too easily, someone just taking things too seriously PLEASE educate yourself. It's not as easy as lightening up or relaxing. We aren't depressed because of how we see the world, we see the world in a bleaker way because we are depressed. I'm sick. I feel broken. My joints hurt, my head hurts, I feel sick all the time, everything is a physical and mental challenge and it takes all of my energy to just exist. This is what depression really is. And I'm tired of pretending that I don't know this. I feel like I've gone through too many battles privately since I was 13 years old and that maybe speaking out will make this one easier to win. Anyone going through the same thing, perhaps for the first time, should know that it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's an illness and a bastard of one at that. Talk about it with someone who understands, avoid people who are unwilling to be openminded about mental illness, find out what helps you beat it and rearrange your priorities until you start to feel strong enough to tackle other things and stay mentally healthy. You should be your main priority right now and don't be afraid to lean on others for support too. For the first time in my life I'm going to put myself first regardless of what other people think of that. If you think it's time we spoke out about depression and mental illness hit the like or share button, whether you're a sufferer or a sympathiser stamp out the stigma.
