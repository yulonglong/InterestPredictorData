Bundle Feedback from one of our beta testers in Southampton: Really easy to use, good on the eye as well... its great to have something relevant to the area you're in... as all the usual big news apps just cover the UK! Or the local news sites just cover that area only. People always want to know what's going on if they see something on the street or pass an accident...
