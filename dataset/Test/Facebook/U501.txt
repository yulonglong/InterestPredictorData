Laurel Egan   Just finished cleaning out the tool boxes and organizing the tools. Seriously, who does that? I couldn't take trying to find things I knew we had anymore (like electrical tape and Allen wrenches). Although, I made a disturbing discovery in the process. Who else has this many types and sizes of screw drivers? I now feel like a tool hoarder! 13 Likes4 Comments Like  Share 13 people like this.
