BlueHaus Music added 2 new photos. We're quickly coming to the end of BlueHaus Music - Dubai. These 16 months of production time saw over 70 arrangements, hundreds of minutes of edited audio, and... several scores for short films, documentaries and web media. I'm wrapping up work here having made dozens of new friends, lots of great memories, and a new road to the future. With the indispensable help and engineering expertise of Wade Winchip, BlueHaus now has five percussion mallet lines with 48 models for primary, intermediate, and advanced students, teachers and performers. The design work and innovation continues with another summer of testing new materials, finding new suppliers, and fine tuning design specifications. But, the time has come. It's time to pack up the gear and ship out to greener pastures. BlueHaus Music - UK will come online October 1, 2015. The location will be new, but the mission will be the same. BlueHaus will always be about the artistic, commercial, and educational applications of sound. And now, as we move forward to broader horizons, I look forward to making new friends, sharing my love and passion for music, continuing to support teachers, and staying focused on what BlueHaus Music can create for you. Better Sound. Better Life. BlueHaus Music. See More Share 3 people like this.Brad Howard June 22  SoundCloud  Feeling a bit melancholy today.

The piece is a couple of years old and written in application for a job. Didn't get the job, but I still enjoy the work. 1  June 24 at 2:35pmBrad Howard   I'm making plans to attend these music education conventions as an exhibitor for BlueHaus Music percussion keyboard mallets. Jan. 14-16, Fort Wayne, IN Jan. 20-23, Tulsa, OK Jan. 27-30, Peoria, IL... Feb. 3-6, Louisville, KY Feb. 10-13, San Antonio, TX But, I have a challenge. I need to borrow a marimba and vibraphone, and some Orff instruments as well e.g. bass and alto xylophone/metallophone. It doesn't make sense to promote mallets and have nothing for conference attendees to play on, so I am appealing to the great social network for some help. If you plan to attend your state music educator convention, have access to an instrument, and are willing to lend it to the BlueHaus booth for the event, I would deeply appreciate it.

Share 8 people like this.Brad Howard June 10  Dubai, United Arab Emirates  It's time to give my ears a break from digital audio processing. Virtually all the audio in our manmade sonic environment is processed and I have three observations. 1) I'm contributing to this digital landscape to make a living and this concerns me. In my defense, I always try to include live audio in my track production. 2) Audio quality expectations are shifting downward as a function of lifestyle. I'll make the leap and state that lower quality contributes to a diminished... quality of life, so is it really worth it? 3) Some music styles are more easily processed than others. This isn't a commentary on the quality of these particular genres, or perhaps it is. For the last several weeks, I've been doing tons of digital audio looping to transcribe some pieces for orchestra and I'm certain that this kind of intense listening work has a negative effect on my psychology. Yes, a few weeks off will do some good. Take this quiz. It's short. Leans to the pop side of life a bit. The 128 files are easy to discern. I had a little more trouble than I'm comfortable admitting choosing between the uncompressed wave and the 320. Ultimately I chose the .wav files over the .mp3 files, but it took more passes than last year when I took a similar quiz.

While in Nottingham, I connected with a business in Somerset that can supply the rattan handle material for our Artist Series vibe mallets. It took some doing, but I finally found someone that can get it in sufficient quantities. It's been challenging to find because of political conditions in SE Asia and the trade economics that are limiting export of material. I suspect that large mallet companies have enough supply in stock to make it through this tough spell. If they don't, I predict an increase in their retail cost with a decrease in quality. Fortunately, for BlueHaus customers, we have a good supply and are working on some new innovations to stand out from the crowd! Check out the link to learn more about Somerset Willow Growers.
