Malaysia Asia added 5 new photos to the album: The Moon in Colors.   Took these photos with my Nikon P900 on 29th July from my condo balcony in KL, Malaysia. I didn't even zoom in full, was about 65x zoom and used different moon settings. Came out not too bad, actually I was very impressed with the details in some of them. Look at the 'Craters' at the bottom of the photos. And taken 'Hand Held' too smile emoticon No tripod!
