Elena Pellizzaris   Edited  i wrote this a year and a half ago, and i find myself returning to it over and over again lately. this weekend, i'll be going off the grid for a much-needed vacation, where i'll be able to completely unplug. that thought used to terrify me; now i welcome it. because a year and a half later, i still want *more*. i want relationships. i want stories with skin on. don't you? your words mean more to me when i get to see you speak them attention, people of the internet; lets do REALTALK for a moment or two here, okay? pour yourself a drink, settle in for a little bit, and stay with me here. i may not know... elenateresaann.com 6 Likes2 Comments Like  Share 6 people like this. Remove Mary Briley Weisner I say this all the time to my son. Everyone should have real skin on friends.
