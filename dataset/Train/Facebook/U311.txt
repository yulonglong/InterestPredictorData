THE HISTORY OF BLACK HAIR #newvideo Hey y'all! I decided to do this video because a lot of Black people don't know the history of Black hair and the signif...icance it held in Africa. I learned some new things as I researched and it made me feel proud to discover more about our history. Efforts are made to erase our culture and connection to Africa so we must do our part to educate ourselves and each other to keep it alive. This is probably the longest I've ever worked on a video and the hardest lol It was really important to me that I posted this and got it right so I hope you guys enjoy it!:) Don't forget to share this with a friend! Peace & Blessings! #blackhair #hairhistory #naturalhair #africa #egypt #slavery #afro #teamnatural_ #myhaircrush #onyxbox #selflove #blackhistory See More Share 2 people like this.Patrick D'Almeida shared Ah Mouf Mid's video.   0:00/6:05 Watch Later 1,850,970 Views Ah Mouf Mid uploaded a new video.
