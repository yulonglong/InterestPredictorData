Remove Laurie Moore Skinner knock 'em dead!! Like  July 19 at 12:04amNile Flores   Arrived in Miami, Florida (actually near Homestead for our hotel.) Not sure if Florida has some deal with Google, but Google Maps kept giving us tolls, rather than I-95 to Highway 1. Tolls were crazy expensive. Kimberly J Castleberry is ready to drop... she's a driving machine! It's raining like cats and dogs here, so no beach til Sunday.... Tomorrow morning is Florida Social Con... excited to present Blogging and Content Creation for WordPress. See More 17 Likes5 Comments Like  Share 17 people like this.

Three months later, I got a ticket for $2.95 plus $3.95 processing fee, Nile & Kimberly. Have fun! Like  1  July 18 at 1:54am Kimberly J Castleberry replied  1 Reply Remove Rita Johnson Lol it's only raining in Miami. I'm about 45 minutes north, and it's sunny. But that's Florida. We're used to it. Also, the toll roads are faster, which is why it's more expensive, and why Google always let's you take them. Trust me on this. But even our free roads have express lanes that have tolls. Welcome to Florida! Lol Like  July 18 at 2:32am Remove Nile Flores I'm not paying for tolls if I can get around them. I had enough last month in Pennsylvania's turnpike with $58 total in tolls Like  July 18 at 2:59am View more replies Remove Lisa League Nasty weather in and around O-town, hope it clears for you soon!
