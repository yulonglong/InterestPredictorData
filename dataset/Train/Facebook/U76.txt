Thanks to Metashar Dillon, Blake Cessario,Tyler Cessario, Emily Cessario, Dylan Cessario, and Darin John Cessario for making this holiday so memorable for me. It was my pleasure to be able to give back with my children by participating in the Kiedc, Mae Ola Riddick, New Haven Police Department toy drive this year. #toysforkids It was a lot of work but I know it was as great of an experience for my own children as it was for the children they helped! 11 Likes Like  Share 11 people like this.Ellen Elkins shared a link.
