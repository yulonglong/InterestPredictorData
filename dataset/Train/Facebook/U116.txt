July 17 at 8:40am  Like Remove Damien Franco Kristan Ryan the thing that killed me was his nonchalance about the incident. We spray every two weeks is not the kind of answer that assuages a patron's concerns. Didn't offer to pick up nor discount the check.

So excited to have Poetic Systems here with us today! Not only did they build our website years ago, they've kept it up to date and are hard at work creating a ...brand new site for us!!! They have been such a blessing and today they came to bless us even more...they are working with the kids on games and the basics of programming!
