FOR SALE: Yacht tender; had a hard life and needs some TLC! 3.5mtrs x 1.5mtrs. no idea how much it's worth but will consider reasonable offers, you will need to collect it from #SuttonHarbour and have either an engine or something to tow it out of harbour as no slip. Proceeds go towards @MorvarghSailing  at Sutton Harbour Marina. +4 2 Likes2 Comments1 Share Like  Share 2 people like this. 1 share Remove Bracken Jelier Hi Matt.
