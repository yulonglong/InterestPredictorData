I have been so inspired by my #network and creative circle on how they express themselves on social media. We may not always agree. But then again we don't have to. ... What I have noticed is there are 4 types of people on social media. 1. Social Media Militants. They are keystroke killers, who keep us aware social issue and culture. They are quick to pop off at the lip but won't pop a grape. 2. The Educators. People who inform and keeps us abreast of what really is happening in the world...not just their world 4. The Creatives: Their minds will take what we think and what is said to the outer limits. Either you like us or you don't. Heck, sometimes even we clash. But at the end of the day, love is love. 3. The Profits. Those of us who leverage influence and information to share value with the world, while covering into profits. [Yes, I fit in two categories] Which one are you? Or are you a combination of one or more? #MyTwoCents #Branding #Business #SocialMedia See More  with TaShan Parks Twyman. 5 Likes10 Comments Like  Share 5 people like this.
