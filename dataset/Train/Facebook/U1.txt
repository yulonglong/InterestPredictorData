Rory Tucker at Origin Design + Communications 13 hrs  Instagram  Meet my new buddy Freddy who came by the office for a visit yesterday. There's SOMETHING about his little face:) I'd love to know what he's thinking or what he'd say if he could speak. Please share your captions for his speech or thought bubble below. #officedog #originvoice #followerparticipationplease 4 Likes6 Comments Like  Comment  Share 4 people like this.

I'm so grateful for it all. The #tuckerboysroadtrip continues onto the last leg briefly through Banff (above) again towards home. Have a great weekend and enjoy all that's around you. 30 Likes4 Comments Like  Comment  Share 30 people like this. Remove Ivy Tucker Even the sky and clouds are teary about you leaving Alberta.
