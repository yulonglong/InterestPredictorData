Da is dat Dingen! Glck Auf! See Translation Like  ShareFerdi Grah shared Andy McKee's post.   Andy McKee I try to stick to music with my page here, but I'm making an exception for this moron. If I can help expose the foolishness of trophy hunting in some way today,... then I will. This is Walter Palmer, a dentist from Minnesota. He illegally killed a treasured lion named Cecil that was living on a national park in Zimbabwe. They lured Cecil off the park with food, shot him with an arrow, let him bleed for 40 hours, then shot him to finish him off before beheading and skinning him. All so this insecure, pathetic, heartless man could have his skull. Walter has been experiencing the world's anger at his actions via social media. Since Cecil can no longer roar, I'm pitching my voice in for him too.
