When you purchase a new modem and it comes with an Ethernet cable... USE the cable that comes with the modem... don't use the cable that's already hooked up to your existing router and old modem. For whatever reason - I had NO internet connection until I used the NEW Ethernet cable... On another note - Comcast said the reason our internet speed was slow was because of our old modem. Our NEW modem still has the same S L O W speed. (Not feeling like being on the phone with them forever tonight - will deal with that later. supposed to have 75MBps - clocking 26.2 and 11.6!) Don't you just LOVE technology??? On the bright side - I have internet. 18 Likes12 Comments Like  Comment  Share 18 people like this. View 8 more comments Remove Donna Dickson Beers If I buy my own modem does comcast have to do anything or do I just plug the cable in to it? Like  Reply  1  July 29 at 1:13am Remove Knikkolette Fahrendorf Church You have to talk to Comcast - give them the serial number and the MAC address so they can put it in there system... That way they can reset it remotely, etc... (which by the way - those numbers are super tiny - I could barely read them even with my glasses on... I think I need to purchase a magnifying glass boy I'm getting old!) Like  Reply  2  July 29 at 1:43am  Edited Remove Skip Bieber The majority of Comcast internet is on shared connections. Think of it as an 1930's era party line. So the actual speeds are based on how many neighbors are also active frown emoticon att is more point-to-point because of the telephone lines going into each home separately.
