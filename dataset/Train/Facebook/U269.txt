The summer's been unusually hot and dry in the French Alps this year, but the course at Evian Resort is in great shape. Environmental initiatives make most efficient use of water to maintain this pristine and verdant venue. A pleasure to play.  playing golf with Nicholas E Boulard at Evian Resort Golf Club. 69 Likes5 Comments Like  Comment  Share 69 people like this.
