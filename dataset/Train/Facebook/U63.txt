For the past three years Jimmy Kimmel has challenged parents to pretend they ate all their kids Halloween Candy, shoot video of it, and upload that video to Yo...uTube. He did it again this year and got more videos than ever before. They've sifted through more than a thousand and whittled it down to our favorites. #YouTubeChallenge If you got too much candy and want to do something other than bring it to the office - you can donate it to the troops.
