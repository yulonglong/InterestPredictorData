No money too outrageous for good coffee! June 3 at 10:11am Remove Kathryn Albert Try making your own, too. I use agave to sweeten it up and add some chocolate almond milk. All it costs is a pound of whole beans course ground in whatever flavor you like. You dilute the cold coffee down to how you like it. I also like to add some cardamom or cinnamon when I'm feeling sassy. June 3 at 10:32amGlenda Hyde shared Sockwork: Socks With A Purpose's photo.
