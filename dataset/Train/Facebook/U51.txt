Karen Reding Free counselling sessions in Norwich area Ever considered counselling, but were unsure due to the cost? Why not try for free and see if you'll benefit from it? ...What's the catch? It'll be for a case study. No personal details of the subject will be used in the case study as I'm the one being examined. Hi, my name is Karen Reding and thanks for reading this far! I'm in the third and final year of my counselling course. I need someone who is over 18 years old and happy to be the subject for a case study, meeting once a week for an hour in the evenings for between 7 - 9 sessions. The counselling style will be psychotherapy. Please contact me at karenreding@gmail.com if you would like to arrange an initial meet up. ------------------ Please help. Advertising on Gumtree and in the library is a last resort. People I know who are interested in having sessions I can pass your details on to other people on my course if you want.
