I seen major successes from only having a dream. I look back on decisions, successes, mistakes and I see life is only a journey. Its a blessing to have met so many great people, and the experiences will never be forgotten. I pray for you all everyday, because you contributed to my life and continue to make it a blessing that it is today. Challenges always appear especially when you are only doing what is destined and is bigger than you, because God is only preping us for what the future may bare. Please forgive me if I have done you wrong or made you feel astray. Thank you all for the love and support. My efforts are done in love. 11 Likes3 Comments Like  Comment  Share 11 people like this.

The butt has been around since the human has been in existence. A giraffe has a butt, a horse has a butt, why are people fascinated with the butt. How did that happen? The butt is made to sit, the butt is made to do do. Don't get me wrong, her butt is big...and beautiful, but for people to be fascinated with the butt makes me question what is next? Should the Next style be the adam and ...Eve leaf, like you see in those Bible pictures? I guess we are subconsciously turning back to animals, what happened to consciousness? What happened to class? Is this really sexy? I must've missed the memo that been going around. I knew girls with big butts my whole life. To worship the butt is like worshiping a rabbit foot for good luck. Now that's how I feel.Hopefully our new generation of children see these things as ignorance rather then a means of standard. God help us all. #fin See More PAPERMAG: NO FILTER: An Afternoon With Kim Kardashian http://www.papermag.com/2014/11/kim_kardashian.php www.papermag.com 8 Likes4 Comments Like  Comment  Share 8 people like this.
