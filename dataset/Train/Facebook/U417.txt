Walked out my door, walked three miles into the hills, and came up with this 1.25- x 1.5-inch find digging (with my hands) at a spot near a wooded creek. Is this a thumbnail scraper or an unfinished head? Any info (date, type of rock, etc.) would be much appreciated! My first find! 6 Likes3 Comments Like  Comment  Share 5 people like this.

I'll give those items some research. Learning as I go! Per Greg's request, I'll post another photo of this and a couple of others soon. May 3, 2011 at 2:09am  Like Write a comment...
