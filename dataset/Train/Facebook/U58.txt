Thanks again for commenting on my post about helping INTech Camp for Girls expand into South Carolina. I wanted to follow up and let you know that we are still accepting donations of all amounts at INTechCamp.co/Donate. Every little bit helps in getting more girls IN technology. If you'd also like to discuss in-kind donation options (we also need help in other ways, not just monetary), please let me know! I sent you an e-mail (and maybe a text) so let me know a goo...d time to chat soon. As always, thank you so much for your support!
