Each son would have some unique strides above their parents... I sure hope my boy does. One can not pick just how all of these strides will manifest themselves. I believe Fred is such a person, and I enjoy working with someone of his calibre. Many of the rest of the world get dimmer by each copy you make... I'm glad you are not one of those....I'd have to kill Ya.
